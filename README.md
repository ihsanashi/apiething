# A Pie Thing

This is a HTML/CSS project I had done to build a website for a local eatery here called "A Pie Thing". The main goal of this personal project was to explore and sharpen my skills in writing clean, semantic HTML, making use of Bootstrap classes where necessary, as well as getting to grips with CSS Grid.

Currently only the homepage has been built. I do plan on working on the other pages later, and I plan on learning Vue JS by building the online store. We'll see how it goes, but I'll definitely come back to this later on.
